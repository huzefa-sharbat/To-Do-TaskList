├── components/
│   ├── InputComponents.jsx    # Input field and Add button component

## 💻 How It Works

1. State Management: Uses React hooks (useState) to manage application state
2. Component Architecture: Modular component structure for better code organization
3. Props Passing: Efficient data flow between parent and child components
4. Event Handling: Handles user interactions for adding and deleting tasks

## 🎯 Core Functionality

Add Todo: Enter task in input field and click "Add" button
Delete Todo: Click "Delete" button on any task to remove it
Input Validation: Prevents adding empty tasks

## 🔮Future Enhancements
